============================================================================
Product Report
============================================================================
Purpose:
	- This report consolidates key product metrics and behavior.
Highlights:
	1. Gather essential fields such as product name, category, subcategory,
	   and cost.
	2. Segment products by revenue to identify High-Performers, Mid-Range,
	   or Low-Performers.
	3. Aggregate product-level metrics:
		- total orders
		- total customers
		- total sales
		- total quantity sold
		- total products (unique)
		- lifespan (in months)
	4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
		- recency (months since last order)
		- average order value
		- average monthly spend
